# AI IMAGE GENERATION MERN APP

Creating a DALL-E clone using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack serves the purpose of developing an innovative and interactive web application that leverages advanced AI image generation capabilities.

This project combines the power of the MERN stack for robust backend and frontend development with the cutting-edge technology of DALL-E, an AI model known for generating creative and unique images from textual descriptions. 

By building this clone, the goal is to provide users with a platform where they can input textual prompts and witness AI-generated images in real-time. This not only showcases the technical prowess of MERN development but also highlights the fusion of web technologies and artificial intelligence, offering a visually engaging and forward-thinking user experience.


## Tech Stack

### Client:

**React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components.

**TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization.

### Server: 
**Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side execution of JavaScript code. 

**Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable server-side applications.

### Databases:
**MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format (BSON). 
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Manya8304/dall-e.git
```

Go to the server folder

```bash
  cd .\server\ 
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

The above commands will connect the database and server side, on the port:- **http://localhost:8080**

Now, to start the client-side, follow these steps:-

Go to the project directory

```bash
    cd ..
```

Go to the client folder

```bash
    cd .\client\
```

Start the server

```bash
    npm run dev
```
The site is live on the port:- **http://localhost:5173/**
